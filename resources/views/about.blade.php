      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        BMI is a widely used screening tool that relates your weight to your height. It can help identify possible weight-related health risks and start conversations with your doctor. It is not a full health check—it does not replace professional advice—but it is a useful first step toward understanding your body and wellness.
